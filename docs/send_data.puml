header P2P Connection - sending data

left to right direction

actor "Host" as host

rectangle "Connections Pool" {
  usecase pool
  usecase "Peer" as p1
  usecase "Peer" as p2
  usecase "Peer" as p3
}

host --> pool : Broadcast
pool --> p1 : Send
pool --> p2 : Send
pool --> p3 : Send

note right of host
We're not sending standard broadcast packets
rather we're sending the same message to all
the peers, the effect however might be compared
to a broadcast, thus the naming used in code
for the method used to send the data.
end note
